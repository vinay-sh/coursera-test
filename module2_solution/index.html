It has 30 teams (29 in the United States and 1 in Canada). The NBA is one of the four major North American professional sports leagues.

	<section class = "col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12"> <p class = "pee"><span class ="spee1" >Ice Hockey</span> Ice hockey is a contact team sport played on ice, usually in a rink, in which two teams of skaters use their sticks to shoot a vulcanized rubber puck into their opponent's net to score points. Ice hockey teams usually consist of six players each: one goaltender, and five players who skate up and down the ice trying to take the puck and score a goal against the opposing team. </p> </section>
	<section class = "col-lg-4 col-md-12 col-sm-12"> <p class = "pee"><span class ="spee2" >Baseball</span> Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of nine players each who take turns batting and fielding. The batting team attempts to score runs by hitting a ball that is thrown by the pitcher with a bat swung by the batter, then running counter-clockwise around a series of four bases: first, second, third, and home plate. A run is scored when a player advances around the bases and returns to home plate. </p> </section>
